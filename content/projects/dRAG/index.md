dRAG dynamically generates a corpus about your Snowflake/Databrickcs schema and uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to answer specific questions about your data.

Additionally, dRAG can convert your question into a SQL statement and run the SQL statement in your data warehouse to find the answer for you.
