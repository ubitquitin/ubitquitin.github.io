Comparative analysis of deep learning methodologies to predict heart disease from heartbeat ECG waveforms. LSTM models, transformer networks, timeseries to image encodings, CNN, tiled-CNN, and transfer learning methodologies were explored to maximize accuracy. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) were developed to generate realistic heartbeat samples to augment dataset.
