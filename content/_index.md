 ## Reccommendation model ##

<img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="animerecsimage.PNG">

<div style="text-align: center"> Anime recommendation service that returns top n most similar shows to the user's queried show. Neural Collaborative Filtering was implemented and embeddings deployed onto a RESTful endpoint. Serverless framework was used to spin up API Gateway + Lambda stack using infrastructure as code development. Todo: deploy addional endpoints that utilize LLM embeddings and compare a user based recommendation approach with a text similarity one.   </div>

 ## Heartbeat Classification ##

<img align="center" width="500" height="500" src="heartbeat.png">


<div style="text-align: center">Comparative analysis of deep learning methodologies to predict heart disease from heartbeat ECG waveforms. LSTM models, transformer networks, timeseries to image encodings, CNN, tiled-CNN, and transfer learning methodologies were explored to maximize accuracy. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) were developed to generate realistic heartbeat samples to augment dataset. </div>
